		<title><![CDATA[Texts of all possible varieties and types are written with ease, due to learners’ extensive vocabulary, and to their mastery of linguistic structures and stylistic devices. As regards style, texts are developed and presented that are interesting enough to facilitate readers’ understanding (even of difficult lines of thought) and which help them retain details. As opposed to Level C1, this is a linguistic and intellectual level which is usually reached by educated native speakers only. ]]></title>

		<title><![CDATA[On this Level, readers can understand texts (non-fiction or literary texts) that clearly allow them to recognise a writer’s viewpoint, and which are about topics that are relevant to life in our society. Such texts may be used to extract essential information; or they may be scanned, to gain a first impression of them. As opposed to B1, these are linguistically more demanding texts with a much greater vocabulary, with more complex linguistic structures, and on a greater variety of topics. ]]></title>

		<title><![CDATA[Understanding most texts in detail is practically no problem – even texts that are difficult content-wise or linguistically. As opposed to Level B2, learners can now consciously differentiate between formal and informal speech, and can recognise finer stylistic qualities, e. g. in a literary text. Texts can be understood even though readers may not be familiar with a given specialisation. Dictionaries are used only if the exact meaning of a word cannot be inferred from the context, or to clarify detailed nuances.]]></title>
